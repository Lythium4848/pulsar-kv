# PulsarKV

PulsarKV is a key-value store for Garry's Mod. It allows for users to store and retrieve data in a simple manner.
Users can upload, update, and delete data if they have the correct permissions.
All data is stored within a MySQL database and gets automatically networked to all clients.

This addon depends on Updatr and MySQLoo - If installing standalone, make sure to install these dependencies.
If you are using PulsarLib, then PulsarKV will automatically be installed and loaded as needed.
